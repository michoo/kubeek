Hi kubeekers!

Kubeek is a project to share messages over a RGB LED Matrix on a Raspberry pi. You can access with REST Api to plot points, circles,... and send text messages. You can also develop your applications (in Java - some examples available in repo) to give you the info you expect.
So enjoy this GPL software!
```
$ cd dist/kubeek/
$ ./kubeek_start.sh
```
